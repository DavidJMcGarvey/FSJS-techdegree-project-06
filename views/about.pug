            | I want to join your development team to help create and maintain accessible websites.
            | Family circumstance took me from Denver, where I was the GM of a music venue, to the Pacific Northwest where I've been a learning to code. 
            | While enrolled in Treehouse's Techdegree, I have built a strong foundation in JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and Python. I am experienced 
            | in a moderate amount of tools including React, Express, Django, and jQuery. I have an understanding of 
            | object-oriented programing concepts and can navigate the asynchronous nature of JavaScript.
            | I am an eager learner and love to solve problems. My aim is set on becoming an expert in all things cyber security. 
            | I want to help protect our representations online as it becomes more intertwined with how we communicate and interact. 
            | I'm sure that my addition to your team will yield great results.
